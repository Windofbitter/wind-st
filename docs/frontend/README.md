# Frontend Docs

Front door for UI documentation. Use these to keep the React app boring, predictable, and user-safe.

- `architecture.md` – runtime stack, routing, layout, state conventions, i18n/theme, DnD usage.
- `api-reference.md` – DTO shapes and endpoints mirrored from `frontend/src/api/**`.
- `flows.md` – critical user flows and invariants you must not break.
